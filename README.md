# S2KNI-SLAM
The method we propose, S2KNI-SLAM, can achieve centimeter-level localization and high-fidelity reconstruction of large-scale scenes in just 3 seconds. S2KNI-SLAM outperforms existing methods in both localization accuracy and reconstruction quality.

The system also represents the scene using a multi-resolution hash grid, incorporates a dynamic hierarchical hashing strategy to reduce hash collisions, and improves robustness and adaptability through a Kalman filtering-based error compensation mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction within 3 seconds and enables long-distance, centimeter-level localization in large-scale outdoor scenes and similar environments, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and offering a novel solution to SLAM challenges. We visualized the reconstruction process of the S2KNI-SLAM, as shown below:

We propose S2KNI-SLAM, a real-time SLAM system based on spatial structure knowledge representation and multi-resolution hash grid implicit reconstruction. By integrating dynamic adaptive positional encoding, contextual cross-fusion attention mechanisms, multi-resolution hash grid, dynamic hierarchical hashing strategy, and Kalman filter-based error compensation, S2KNI-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art results in both localization accuracy and scene reconstruction. Demonstrated across multiple datasets, it excels in camera pose estimation, scene reconstruction, and novel view synthesis. We believe S2KNI-SLAM sets a new benchmark in SLAM and novel view synthesis, making precise localization, high-fidelity reconstruction, and real-time capability attainable. This advancement paves the way for more complex and efficient SLAM systems and provides a robust framework for scene understanding and exploration in embodied intelligence.
